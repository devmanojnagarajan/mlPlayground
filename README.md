Machine Learning for Solubility Prediction

This project demonstrates a fundamental machine learning workflow for predicting the aqueous solubility of molecules based on their chemical descriptors. The notebook covers data loading, data preparation, model training, evaluation, and comparison of two different regression models.

üìù Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can predict the logS value (logarithm of solubility) for a given molecule. We use a set of molecular descriptors as features to train our models. This is a classic example of a regression task in cheminformatics.

The notebook walks through the following key steps:

    Data Loading: The well-known Delaney solubility dataset is loaded directly from a public repository.

    Data Preparation: The dataset is separated into features (X) and the target variable (y), and then split into training and testing sets.

    Model Training: Two common regression models are trained on the data:

        Linear Regression

        Random Forest Regressor

    Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated on both the training and test data using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R¬≤) metrics.

    Results Comparison: The evaluation metrics are compiled into a summary table to easily compare the performance of the models.

    Data Visualization: A scatter plot is generated to visualize the model's predictions against the actual values for the training data.

üìä Dataset

The project uses the Delaney Solubility Dataset.

    Source: The dataset is loaded from the Data Professor's GitHub repository.

    Description: It contains 1144 molecules with their corresponding experimentally measured logS values.

Features (Molecular Descriptors)

    MolLogP: Octanol/water partition coefficient

    MolWt: Molecular weight

    NumRotatableBonds: Number of rotatable bonds

    AromaticProportion: Proportion of aromatic atoms

Target Variable

    logS: The logarithm of the aqueous solubility in mol/L.

‚öôÔ∏è Models & Evaluation

Two regression models were built and compared:

    Linear Regression: A simple and interpretable linear model.

    Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble model that uses multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. (Note: The model in the notebook is configured with max_depth=2 for simplicity).

The models were evaluated using two standard regression metrics:

    Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. Lower values are better.

    R-squared (R¬≤): Represents the proportion of the variance for the target variable that's explained by the model. Values are between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.

üìà Results

The performance of the models on the training and test sets is summarized below. The Linear Regression model showed slightly better performance on the test set in this particular run.
Method	Training MSE	Training R¬≤	Test MSE	Test R¬≤
Linear Regression	1.0075	0.7645	1.0207	0.7892
Random Forest Regression	1.0282	0.7645	1.4077	0.7892

Training Performance Visualization

The following plot shows the correlation between the experimental logS values and the values predicted by the Linear Regression model on the training data.
